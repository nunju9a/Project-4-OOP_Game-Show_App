# OOP Game Show App
- Received grade of "Exceeds Expectations"

Created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Star Wars Hunter." Using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), it selects a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase (Star Wars character). If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears. A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard.

There is an event listener for the user's physical keyboard, so they have the choice to use the onscreen or their own physical keyboard.
Multiple changes have been made to HTML and CSS. Specifically the styling of the keyboard; the overlay, winning, and losing screens all have picture backgrounds. There is a Star Wars logo displayed during the game, and all titles have been changed to match the Star Wars theme. The life hearts also slide away when the loser misses. I also embedded the Star Wars theme song, which autoplays when the page first loads and continues through all stages.
